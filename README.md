## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting burnout in GitHub discussions by analyzing issues and pull requests from the PowerToys project. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, the team aims to identify positive, neutral, and negative comments, as well as detect signs of burnout.

## Main Goals

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Run sentiment analysis to categorize comments into positive, neutral, and negative.
2. **Burnout Detection**: Identify comments indicating burnout, based on the presence of related words and sentiments.
3. **Neural Network/NLP Prediction**: Employ deep learning and NLP techniques to predict burnout signs in issue and pull request discussions.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, along with other Neural Network frameworks.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure Python and TensorFlow are installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset by converting the JSON files from the PowerToys project into a suitable format (CSV recommended).
2. Run sentiment analysis and burnout detection scripts:
